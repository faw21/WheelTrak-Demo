    <h2><b>Mobile App</b></h2>
    <p>Globally, more than 250 million adults, aged 60 and older, experience moderate to severe disability that limits their mobility, activities of daily living, and participation in society. For the elderly population, wheelchairs are often needed for safe mobility and when they are appropriate and reliable, they contribute to well-being, independence and help to prevent or delay the need for long-term care. Unfortunately, data collected over the past two decades suggest that wheelchairs commonly fail, and this occurs most frequently (about ever 2-3 months) in the adverse environments common in low-middle income countries (LMIC) and rural areas of high-income settings. One-third of these breakdowns result in injury, depression, and hospitalization raising the public health and personal burden. Without a functional wheelchair, the user has to stay in bed and suffer from health complications such as pressure sores which may cause death.</p>
    <p>Preventative wheelchair maintenance is known to reduce or prevent breakdowns. However, compliance with current maintenance recommendations is rare in part because the maintenance schedules are generic and not tailored to how the wheelchair is actually used. Consequently, users who are highly active and/or use their wheelchairs in adverse environments may continue to experience breakdowns even if they maintain their device based on recommendations. And alternatively, users who are less active or mainly operate in an indoor or urban environment may perform regular maintenance and replacements but feel that it is too frequent and arduous. With the advent of low-cost sensor technology and widespread use of smartphones in LMICs, we argue that at a negligible cost, it is now possible to monitor wheelchair usage and provide tailored alerts when maintenance is required so that breakdowns and related health risks can be significantly reduced. We have developed a smartphone application named ‘WheelTrak’ that measures wheelchair usage using a wheelchair wear index (WWI) that is based on distance travelled by the user, and ground shock and vibration exposures. Once maintenance is due as per WWI, the user can be alerted with a notification.</p>
    <p>The goal of our proposed study is to characterize and validate the WWI for elderly users with wheelchair models used in LMICs. To achieve this goal, we will address the following study aims in collaboration with Mexico’s National Institute of Geriatrics (INGER) who coordinate with local wheelchair clinics through their worldwide service partner network.</p>
