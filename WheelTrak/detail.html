    <h2><b>Project Detail</b></h2>


    <p>We will be recruiting wheelchair users who are over 60 years old and have been using a wheelchair for at least five years to participate in our project. Prior to the start of the program, you will be informed of the study procedure and compensation arrangements. Your demographic data and maintenance and repair histories will be collected. A data logger sensor will be mounted on the rear wheel to measure use and wear factors. Data on wheelchair use parameters like shocks, vibrations, distance traveled, temperature and humidity) will be collected for a week. </p>
    <p>Wheelchair inspections will be carried out to evaluate existing wheelchair failures. Our researcher will use the validated Wheelchair Condition Questionnaire (WCQ-C) for assessing the condition of wheelchair parts. Caster and rear-wheel tire wear will be measured. Failures and breakdowns observed during the study will be documented. For wheelchairs, casters and rear wheels have been found to suffer most failures with very little use, and hence, the frequency of failures with these parts will be used to determine the nominal Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI). A secondary analysis will be conducted in which failure frequencies of other wheelchair parts such as brakes, footrests, and frames will be individually correlated with WWI. If they have a high correlation, these parts will be included with casters and rear wheels to develop preventative maintenance events individualized for each part. Routine maintenance to avoid corrosion and contamination failures caused by hot and humid climates will be included in the schedule as per the study's findings.</p>
    <p>The sensor will be recovered from you as a participant after completing data collection after a week. A study staff member will visit the participant for this purpose.</p>
    <p>You and your caregiver will be contacted after 6 months to record the failures and repairs that occurred in that time.</p>
