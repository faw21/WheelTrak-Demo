    <h2><b>Project Detail</b></h2>

    <p>More  than  50%wheelchair  users  experience  wheelchair  breakdowns  every 6months and  one  in  three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Majority of the breakdowns occur due to caster failures that cause a wheelchair to tip, user to fall out of the chair and get injured.Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations  is  extremely  low because maintenance tools developed  as  a  part  of  training programs are generic and not reflective of how and where  the  wheelchair is being used.</p>
    <p>No tool currently exists to monitor wheelchair  usage, predict  caster  failures  and  trigger  maintenance  reminders. To  address  this  issue,  we  are developing  a  low-power, Internet  of  Things  device that tracks  wheelchair  condition  and leverages  artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations for casters and other critical wheelchair parts. This device  will  be  a  part  of  our  ongoing  development  of  IoT  system  called  WheelTrak.  It  currently  includes  a smartphone application that connects with sensors mounted on the wheelchair (instrumentation to be replaced by  IoT  device) and  cloud server for data storage  and analysis. We  plan  to  develop  the  cloud-based  machine learning  algorithms  as  a  part  of  this  IoT  device  development  and  validation</p>
    <p>We will be recruiting wheelchair users to participate in our project. Prior to the start of the program, you will be informed of the study procedure and compensation arrangements. Your demographic data and maintenance and repair histories will be collected. A data logger sensor will be mounted on the rear wheel to measure use and wear factors. Data on wheelchair use parameters like shocks, vibrations, distance traveled, temperature and humidity) will be collected for a week. </p>
    <p>The sensor will be recovered from you as a participant after completing data collection after a week. A study staff member will visit the participant for this purpose.</p>
    <p>You and your caregiver will be contacted after 6 months to record the failures and repairs that occurred in that time.</p>
